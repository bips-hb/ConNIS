Title: Calculate the probabilites of non-insertion sequences in Tn5 transposon data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Moritz Hanke
Maintainer: Moritz Hanke <moritzhanke@icloud.com>
Description: For each gene of a Tn5 trasnposon the probability of the biggest observed insertion free gap within the gene is calculated. Therefore the probability distribution of observing a sequence of misses for a finite number of fair Bernoulli trials given a total number of successes is used.
